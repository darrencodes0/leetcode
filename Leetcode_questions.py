House Robber: Maximize the amount of money you can rob from houses without robbing two adjacent houses.
Longest Common Subsequence: Find the longest subsequence common to two strings.
Knapsack Problem: Solve the 0/1 knapsack problem.
7. Trees and Graphs
Binary Tree Inorder Traversal: Traverse a binary tree in inorder.
Level Order Traversal: Perform a level-order traversal (breadth-first search) of a binary tree.
Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree: Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a BST.
Graph Traversals: BFS (breadth-first search) and DFS (depth-first search) on graphs.

Hamming Distance: Calculate the Hamming distance between two integers.
Power of Two: Check if a number is a power of two.
11. Sliding Window
Maximum Subarray: Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters: Find the longest substring with at most K distinct characters.
Minimum Size Subarray Sum: Find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is at least a given value.
Tips for Preparation:
Practice with Constraints: Be mindful of time and space complexity. Often, you'll need to optimize brute-force solutions.
Understand the Algorithm: Donâ€™t just memorize solutions. Understand the underlying algorithms, as interviewers may ask you to explain or modify them.
Edge Cases: Always think about edge cases, like empty arrays, strings, or null values, and handle them in your solutions.
Focusing on these key topics will give you a solid foundation for your first CS internship interview. Good luck with your preparation! Let me know if you'd like detailed explanations or examples of any specific question.
