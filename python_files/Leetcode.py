Tips for Preparation:
Practice with Constraints: Be mindful of time and space complexity. Often, you'll need to optimize brute-force solutions.
Understand the Algorithm: Donâ€™t just memorize solutions. Understand the underlying algorithms, as interviewers may ask you to explain or modify them.
Edge Cases: Always think about edge cases, like empty arrays, strings, or null values, and handle them in your solutions.
Focusing on these key topics will give you a solid foundation for your first CS internship interview. Good luck with your preparation! Let me know if you'd like detailed explanations or examples of any specific question.
